<p class="p1"><span class="s1">4194304's Website</span></p>
<p class="p2"><span class="s2">Hosted on GitHub pages for no rhyme or reason. (Getting a new URL is like waiting for 2.2 in 2018)</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">You most likely came from that link for a Website that needs an overhaul and this, being my first webpage, really needed an overhaul.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Asking for a list of all of my Projects? <a href="https://stereomadnessss.github.io/list/"><span class="s3">Here it is!</span></a></span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">Why 4194304 instead of StereoMadnessss?</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">The name largely was my first <a href="https://store.steampowered.com/app/322170/Geometry_Dash/"><span class="s3">Geometry Dash</span></a> username and as such it was mostly random. StereoMadnessss was based off of the first level's name. Over time, I would become more embraced with the whole idea of technical things and distance effects. 4194304 is 2^22 which in Bedrock Edition, makes you fall through the world if you are not sprinting.</span></p>

<p class="p5"><span class="s2">Hypixel</span></p>
<p class="p5"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">I did have other interests over computing. I had better things to do obviously that I would enjoy.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Mainly I loved to play with friends in a peaceful Survival Server for everyone. However later I would see a new light for me as a player.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">See Hypixel. I loved it. Mainly I played with friends there and did things like bedwars but getting away from the beginning, we will enter Housing where I had fun messing with the Door Glitch on TommyInnit's house but I left it and over 4 months later I would see Housing again.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Seeing Freebuilds, I looked at their elegancy and saw their builds. I built and built random things and took a look around for a bit until I completely put myself into a new person.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In a Freebuild Admins shoes, it was nice being there. You have permissions to do tons of things and you also have to ban some people who were greifing occasionally.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p4"><span class="s2">A New Path</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">Continuing for over 5 more months and I was in a new path. I was getting bored of housing and I was more alone with my choices and I was setting myself on my own path that was entirely new.</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2"><br>
</span></p>
<p class="p3"><span class="s2">In February I changed my username to 4194304 and I have been going in the same path since March. Mostly doing random things.</span></p>
